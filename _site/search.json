    "text": "With 183 primary schools in Singapore (as of 2019), parents of primary school students may require to ballot during the Primary 1 (P1) Registration Exercise to secure a place in a preferred school. One main criteria that affects a student’s priority of admission is his/her residential’s distance away from the school of choice. The Home-School Distance category is an important factor that secures a place for the child in the primary school, and thus an available school within the acceptable distance of the family’s residential address in turn affects the accessibility to schools in the acceptable area.\nWith recent mergers and closures of primary schools in the past few years, the government has mentioned about the due to shrinking school cohorts and declining birth rates. In order to visualize the negative effects of closures on the accessibility of schools for some students living in certain residential areas and subzones, using a geographic system would be helpful. As such, our team from SMU began working on this project to conduct geospatial analytics to analyze the possible decreased accessibility for certain families who have children studying in primary schools."

    "text": "Limitations\n\nCalculation of Affected Residentials\nThe first limitation of this method is that due to human error of tracing the polygon, the number of\nresidential centroids may differ slightly from each user to another user. In order to reduce this error, we\ncan zoom in to the polygon as close as we can to trace the shape as accurately as possible. The second\nlimitation is that the distance between two schools may be so close that the polygons may intersect one\nanother, which would lead to inaccurate results. In order to reduce this limitation, we can try to find an\nequal distance between both schools and split the polygon into half.\n\n\nUse of (Centroids of) Hexagonal Grids to Represent Affected Residentials\nBy using hexagonal grids to represent groups of residential landuse areas on the mainland layer, it\ncreates an inaccuracy of the number of residential buildings that have truly been affected by the closure\nof the schools. In addition, even though some parts of the grid may be covered by the buffer or output\npolygons, the hexagonal grid will not be selected if the centroid does not overlap. Therefore, the size of\nthe hexagonal grid used is a limitation that we had to consider as assigning a centroid to each residential\nlanduse area/building would have been computationally too intensive.\n\n\nMethod of finding Shortest Path and Fastest Time\nA limitation of this method that we encountered was that some of the output polygons that we\nproduced were abnormal in terms of how it was formed on the map. This resulted in inaccurate data\nthat was produced for the number of affected residentials. This meant that the data had to be represented by NA. A possible alternative would be to use the Distance Interval method, but it is also\ncomputationally intensive."

    "text": "Data Analysis\n\nSubzone Analysis of Students to School Ratio\n\nThe number of primary schools are represented by red hue, and the number of primary school students\nare represented by blue hues. Therefore, the redder hue on the final image indicates that there are\nmore schools in that particular subzone compared to the relative number of students in the subzone.\nVice versa, the bluer the hue, the more student to school in the subzone. The darker regions indicate\nthat there are a lot of schools as well as a lot of students in the subzone. Analysis also shows that the\nMalcom subzone has a lot of schools but relatively a lot fewer student count.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubzone with the most number of students\nWoodlands East (1150), Tampines East (1130)\n\n\nSubzone with the most number of schools\nTampines East (7), Yunnan (5), Woodlands East (5)\n\n\n\nAccording to Statista, the enrolment has been showing a downward trend since 2011 and only sees a\nsmall spike in 2019.\n \nThis data is in line with the data for declining birthrate since 2015 as shown below.\n\nIn the table taken from Education Statistics Digest 2020, we can see the enrolment number and number\nof classes with average class size for 2019.\n\nTherefore, with a downward trend of students in schools coupled with declining birth rate, it is\nreasonable for schools to close/merge to provide quality education to the students.\n\n\nNumber of Affected Residentials due to Merger\nIn order to clearly analyze the number of affected residentials due to the closure of the 7 primary\nschools in 2019, the data that has been manually calculated from the data collection portion of this\nstudy has been imported into a Python file so that the data will be more clearly represented. This\nscreenshot below shows a data frame of the affected residentials:\n\nSince the buffer zone covers a greater area as compared to the output polygons created from QNEAT3,\nthere is a larger number of affected residentials represented by the buffer zone and is about 2 to 3 times\nas large as the number of residentials represented by the output polygons.\nWhen looking from the 1km proximity distance from the closed schools, the closure of schools could\naffect up to 16 residential areas (taken from the closure of East Coast Primary School). When looking\nfrom the 2km proximity distance from the closed schools, the closure of schools could affect up to 55\nresidential areas (taken from the closure of Balestier Hill Primary School). From just looking at the data\ncollected by using the buffer method, an average of 14 and 50 residential areas are affected within a\n1km and 2km buffer respectively.\nWith 3 closures in the East, 3 closures in the Central and 1 closure in the North, we have taken a closer\nlook at the subzone analysis that we have previously done. In the Eastern region of Singapore nearer\ntowards the Tampines and Pasir Ris subzones, the proportion of schools to students in these areas are\none of the greatest as compared to the other subzones of Singapore. By closing 3 schools, this would\nmake sense to reduce the school count and balance the ratio of schools to students in the area. In the\nCentral region and especially where East Coast Primary School and Macpherson Primary School were\nonce located, the subzones also mostly show a larger proportion of schools to students, which does\ncorrespond to the government’s decision to close these 2 schools. However, Balestier Hill Primary\nSchool (located centrally) and Da Qiao Primary School (located in the North) have subzones where the\nratio of schools to students are roughly equal as compared to all the subzones in Singapore. By using the\nsame deduction, the closure of these 2 schools would result in a higher student to school ratio, equating\nto a lack of access to schools in these subzones due to high enrolment rates (assuming students apply\nfor schools near their residential areas).\n\n\nNumber of Schools Accessible After the Merger\nWe also wanted to quantify the impact of school closures for each residential centroid, specifically\nlooking at the change in the number of primary schools accessible based on a transport mode. As the\ntop 2 transport modes of primary school students were by walking and driving\n(https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/mode-of-transport/visualising-\ndata/mode-of-transport-dashboard), we looked at both. We looked at the percentage change\n(reduction), instead of the absolute difference as it gives a more accurate representation of how\nresidents are affected.\nOf the 88 affected residentials that are within 1km proximity of the closed primary schools, we\ndiscovered that 3/5 of them still have the same number of primary schools accessible, by walking, within\n1km from where they live (ie a change of 0%). A tenth of them had to walk beyond 1km but not more\nthan a driving distance of 2km. An interesting note is that due to the short distance travelled, the change\nin accessibility did not vary much between the two different transport modes. One obvious difference\nbetween walking and driving is that the residentials who walked had a greater proportion of more than\n50% reduction in accessibility. This means that while there is some disruption to the residents’\naccessibility, the impact is not too great.\n\nOf the 288 affected residentials that are within 2km proximity of the closed primary schools, there is\nundoubtedly a larger proportion of them being unaffected by the closures as compared to the\nresidentials above. The only proportion that remained unchanged is when the travelling distance is 1km."

    "text": "Background\nWith 183 primary schools in Singapore (as of 2019), parents of primary school students may require to ballot during the Primary 1 (P1) Registration Exercise to secure a place in a preferred school. One main criteria that affects a student’s priority of admission is his/her residential’s distance away from the school of choice. The Home-School Distance category is an important factor that secures a place for the child in the primary school, and thus an available school within the acceptable distance of the family’s residential address in turn affects the accessibility to schools in the acceptable area.\nWith recent mergers and closures of primary schools in the past few years, the government attributed it to shrinking school cohorts and declining birth rates (Statista, 2021). In order to visualize the negative effects of closures on the accessibility of schools for some students living in certain residential areas and subzones, using a geographic system would be helpful. As such, our team from SMU began working on this project to conduct geospatial analytics to analyze the possible decreased accessibility for certain families who have children studying in primary schools."

We chose this year to analyze because it is the latest fully completed process as compared to ongoing ones now.

Our primary objective would be to discover the extent of the decreased accessibility, given the assumption that the closure of a school reduces a student’s opportunity to enrol into a primary school. Our network analysis will take on three different approaches, finding the buffering distance, finding the shortest network distance, and finding the fastest network distance. To analyze this further, we will consider the top transport modes that primary school students would use to get to school; by foot and private transport. Based on our results, we will be able to derive the possible extent of these closures from the perspectives of the public."
