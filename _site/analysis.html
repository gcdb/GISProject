<p>The number of primary schools are represented by red hue, and the number of primary school students<br>
are represented by blue hues. Therefore, the redder hue on the final image indicates that there are<br>
more schools in that particular subzone compared to the relative number of students in the subzone.<br>
Vice versa, the bluer the hue, the more student to school in the subzone. The darker regions indicate<br>
that there are a lot of schools as well as a lot of students in the subzone. Analysis also shows that the<br>
Malcom subzone has a lot of schools but relatively a lot fewer student count.</p>

<p>According to Statista, the enrolment has been showing a downward trend since 2011 and only sees a<br>
small spike in 2019.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-4E878357.png" class="img-fluid"> <img src="images/paste-D3F6E116.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This data is in line with the data for declining birthrate since 2015 as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-CA6F60AF.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In the table taken from Education Statistics Digest 2020, we can see the enrolment number and number<br>
of classes with average class size for 2019.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-96C0ABC8.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Therefore, with a downward trend of students in schools coupled with declining birth rate, it is<br>
reasonable for schools to close/merge to provide quality education to the students.</p>

<section id="number-of-affected-residentials-due-to-merger" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="number-of-affected-residentials-due-to-merger"><em>Number of Affected Residentials due to Merger</em></h5>
<p>In order to clearly analyze the number of affected residentials due to the closure of the 7 primary<br>
schools in 2019, the data that has been manually calculated from the data collection portion of this<br>
study has been imported into a Python file so that the data will be more clearly represented. This<br>
screenshot below shows a data frame of the affected residentials:</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-119D9659.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Since the buffer zone covers a greater area as compared to the output polygons created from QNEAT3,<br>
there is a larger number of affected residentials represented by the buffer zone and is about 2 to 3 times<br>
as large as the number of residentials represented by the output polygons.<br>
When looking from the 1km proximity distance from the closed schools, the closure of schools could<br>
affect up to 16 residential areas (taken from the closure of East Coast Primary School). When looking<br>
from the 2km proximity distance from the closed schools, the closure of schools could affect up to 55<br>
residential areas (taken from the closure of Balestier Hill Primary School). From just looking at the data<br>
collected by using the buffer method, an average of 14 and 50 residential areas are affected within a<br>
1km and 2km buffer respectively.<br>
With 3 closures in the East, 3 closures in the Central and 1 closure in the North, we have taken a closer<br>
look at the subzone analysis that we have previously done. In the Eastern region of Singapore nearer<br>
towards the Tampines and Pasir Ris subzones, the proportion of schools to students in these areas are<br>
one of the greatest as compared to the other subzones of Singapore. By closing 3 schools, this would<br>
make sense to reduce the school count and balance the ratio of schools to students in the area. In the<br>
Central region and especially where East Coast Primary School and Macpherson Primary School were<br>
once located, the subzones also mostly show a larger proportion of schools to students, which does<br>
correspond to the government's decision to close these 2 schools. However, Balestier Hill Primary<br>
School (located centrally) and Da Qiao Primary School (located in the North) have subzones where the<br>
ratio of schools to students are roughly equal as compared to all the subzones in Singapore. By using the<br>
same deduction, the closure of these 2 schools would result in a higher student to school ratio, equating<br>
to a lack of access to schools in these subzones due to high enrolment rates (assuming students apply<br>
for schools near their residential areas).</p>

<section id="number-of-schools-accessible-after-the-merger" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="number-of-schools-accessible-after-the-merger"><em>Number of Schools Accessible After the Merger</em></h5>
<p>We also wanted to quantify the impact of school closures for each residential centroid, specifically<br>
looking at the change in the number of primary schools accessible based on a transport mode. As the<br>
top 2 transport modes of primary school students were by walking and driving<br>
(https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/mode-of-transport/visualising-<br>
data/mode-of-transport-dashboard), we looked at both. We looked at the percentage change<br>
(reduction), instead of the absolute difference as it gives a more accurate representation of how<br>
residents are affected.<br>
Of the 88 affected residentials that are within 1km proximity of the closed primary schools, we<br>
discovered that 3/5 of them still have the same number of primary schools accessible, by walking, within<br>
1km from where they live (ie a change of 0%). A tenth of them had to walk beyond 1km but not more<br>
than a driving distance of 2km. An interesting note is that due to the short distance travelled, the change<br>
in accessibility did not vary much between the two different transport modes. One obvious difference<br>
between walking and driving is that the residentials who walked had a greater proportion of more than<br>
50% reduction in accessibility. This means that while there is some disruption to the residents'<br>
accessibility, the impact is not too great.</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-C76071B4.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Of the 288 affected residentials that are within 2km proximity of the closed primary schools, there is<br>
undoubtedly a larger proportion of them being unaffected by the closures as compared to the<br>
residentials above. The only proportion that remained unchanged is when the travelling distance is 1km.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<section id="calculation-of-affected-residentials" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="calculation-of-affected-residentials"><em>Calculation of Affected Residentials</em></h5>
<p>The first limitation of this method is that due to human error of tracing the polygon, the number of<br>
residential centroids may differ slightly from each user to another user. In order to reduce this error, we<br>
can zoom in to the polygon as close as we can to trace the shape as accurately as possible. The second<br>
limitation is that the distance between two schools may be so close that the polygons may intersect one<br>
another, which would lead to inaccurate results. In order to reduce this limitation, we can try to find an<br>
equal distance between both schools and split the polygon into half.</p>

<section id="use-of-centroids-of-hexagonal-grids-to-represent-affected-residentials" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-of-centroids-of-hexagonal-grids-to-represent-affected-residentials"><em>Use of (Centroids of) Hexagonal Grids to Represent Affected Residentials</em></h5>
<p>By using hexagonal grids to represent groups of residential landuse areas on the mainland layer, it<br>
creates an inaccuracy of the number of residential buildings that have truly been affected by the closure<br>
of the schools. In addition, even though some parts of the grid may be covered by the buffer or output<br>
polygons, the hexagonal grid will not be selected if the centroid does not overlap. Therefore, the size of<br>
the hexagonal grid used is a limitation that we had to consider as assigning a centroid to each residential<br>
landuse area/building would have been computationally too intensive.</p>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="method-of-finding-shortest-path-and-fastest-time"><em>Method of finding Shortest Path and Fastest Time</em></h5>
<p>A limitation of this method that we encountered was that some of the output polygons that we<br>
produced were abnormal in terms of how it was formed on the map. This resulted in inaccurate data<br>
that was produced for the number of affected residentials. This meant that the data had to be represented by NA. A possible alternative would be to use the Distance Interval method, but it is also<br>
computationally intensive.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lessons-learnt">Lessons Learnt</h2>
<p>Tristan's:<br>
• Geospatial Analysis is an essential tool for human visualization of the number of schools that are<br>
in someone's proximity area, and how fortunate Singaporeans are that their children have<br>
relatively easy access via walking or private transport to schools<br>
• Most subzones in Singapore have a higher proportion of schools to students, which also show<br>
how students currently will most likely be able to enroll into a school in their residential area.<br>
This also shows why the government may be closing some schools in order to ensure that the<br>
ratio of schools to students is not too large<br>
• In order to maintain the equity of enrolment and registration of P1 students into schools,<br>
residentials that have no or limited access to schools due to the closure of schools within a<br>
certain proximity distance should be given priority in terms of enrolment and registration.</p>
<p><br>
Mahn Yin's:<br>
• Having done the analysis on the subzone and primary school made me appreciate the<br>
meticulous planning done by the relevant parties even more<br>
• Accessibility to schools should not be taken for granted – every child in Singapore is guaranteed<br>
access to education, yet some countries struggle to provide education for even a fraction of<br>
their children.</p>
<p><br>
Jia Xuan's:<br>
• Accessibility to schools can be measured in different metrics. My project group decided to focus<br>
on one metric, which is the number of points (schools/residential centroids). Despite having only<br>
one metric, we approached itfromn two different perspectives for a deeper insight into our<br>
chosen subtheme. This reminded me of how there will always be different perspectives to a<br>
single subject, and we should never stick to just one<br>
• There would always be unfairness in any decision, as shown in how some residentials were<br>
affected more by the school closures than others. Tradeoffs will also be incurred, but they can<br>
be balanced out</p>
